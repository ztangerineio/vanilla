Add Comments: While your script is clear, adding comments to explain each section's purpose and what specific commands do can be helpful for anyone reading or modifying the script in the future.

Error Handling: Consider adding error-checking and handling for the commands you execute. If a command fails, your script should ideally handle the error gracefully and provide useful feedback.

DONE - Dependency Checks: Before removing packages with apt-get remove, it might be a good idea to check if they exist to avoid errors. You can do this with dpkg -l | grep <package_name>.

DONE - Prompt for User Confirmation: You could add a confirmation prompt before removing conflicting packages to ensure the user is aware of what will be removed and agrees to it.

DONE - Check for Existing 'docker' Group: You already check for the existence of the 'docker' group before creating it. This is a good practice to avoid errors if the group already exists.

DONE - Avoid Hardcoding Paths: Instead of hardcoding paths like /home/"$USER"/.docker, you can use "$HOME/.docker", which is a more portable and user-friendly way to reference the user's home directory.

Cleanup: Consider adding cleanup steps, such as removing unnecessary files or packages left after the installation process.

User Feedback: Provide informative messages to the user throughout the script to let them know what's happening.

DONE - Update Package Lists: You might want to update the package lists at the beginning of the script with sudo apt-get update to ensure you're working with the latest package information.

DONE - Use docker Command Without sudo: The script already adds the user to the 'docker' group, which allows using the docker command without sudo. However, you might need to either log out and back in or use newgrp docker (as you've done) to apply the group membership changes. It's good that you've included this step, but make sure to inform the user about it.Add Comments: While your script is clear, adding comments to explain each section's purpose and what specific commands do can be helpful for anyone reading or modifying the script in the future.
